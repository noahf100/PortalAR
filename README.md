# PortalAR
Portal Augmented Reality built on Three js

## Introduction
	
Who doesn't want a portal gun owned by Rick in Rick and Morty on their phone? This webpage spawns portals to arbitrary locations at Brown University. A nice soundbite from Rick and Morty also plays with each spawn.

This is a portal augmented reality webpage based on the [three.ar.js] library by Google. This code was inspired by the spawn-at-camera example found in the repository.
	
This project was created for Hack@Brown 2018.
